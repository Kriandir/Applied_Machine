How to use this program:

1. Decide whether you want to compare the Naive Bayesian with the SVM Method.
If yes you put plot = False at the import statements.
However if you want to compare the Naive Bayesian for different probabilities of the spam/ham ratio you put
plot = True at the import statements.

Run the Code.
(if you are plotting the Bayesian don't run the SVM in order to save time.)
